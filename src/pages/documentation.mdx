## Introduction
This documentation will help you get familiar with the resources of the **Rick and Morty API** and show you how to make different queries, so that you can get the most out of it.

### GraphQL
https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql

```graphql
query {
  characters(page: 2, filter: { name: "rick" }) {
    info {
      count
    }
    results {
      name
    }
  }
  location(id: 1) {
    id
  }
  episodesByIds(ids: [1, 2]) {
    id
  }
}

```
> *New to GraphQL? check the docs [here](https://graphql.org/learn/)*

### REST
**Base url:** https://rickandmortyapi.com/api

The base url contains information about all available API's resources.
All requests are `GET` requests and go over `https`. All responses will return data in `json`.

<RestQuery />

```json
{
  "characters": "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character",
  "locations": "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/location",
  "episodes": "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode"
}
```

There are currently three available resources:
- [Character](#character): used to get all the characters.
- [Location](#location): used to get all the locations.
- [Episode](#episode): used to get all the episodes.

### Info and Pagination
The API will automatically paginate the responses. You will receive up to 20 documents per page.

Each resource contains an `info` object with information about the response.

|Key|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|count|int|The length of the response
|pages|int|The amount of pages
|next|string (url)|Link to the next page (if it exists)
|prev|string (url)|Link to the previous page (if it exists)


<RestQuery endpoint="/character"/>

```json
{
  "info": {
    "count": 826,
    "pages": 42,
    "next": "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/?page=2",
    "prev": null
  },
  "results": [
    // ...
  ]
}
```

You can access different pages with the `page` parameter. If you don't specify any page, the first page will be shown. For example, in order to access page 2, add `?page=2` to the end of the URL.

<RestQuery endpoint="/character/?page=19"/>

```json
{
  "info": {
    "count": 826,
    "pages": 42,
    "next": "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/?page=20",
    "prev": "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/?page=18"
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 361,
      "name": "Toxic Rick",
      "status": "Dead",
      "species": "Humanoid",
      "type": "Rick's Toxic Side",
      "gender": "Male",
      "origin": {
        "name": "Alien Spa",
        "url": "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/location/64"
      },
      "location": {
        "name": "Earth",
        "url": "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/location/20"
      },
      "image": "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/avatar/361.jpeg",
      "episode": [
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/27"
      ],
      "url": "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/361",
      "created": "2018-01-10T18:20:41.703Z"
    },
    // ...
  ]
}
```

### JavaScript client
The Rick and Morty API JavaScript client is a [fully typed](https://javascript.rickandmortyapi.com/modules/interfaces.html) client that gives you access to the API and its features. 

- [View on GitHub](https://github.com/afuh/rick-and-morty-api-node)

### Filter characters
You can also include filters in the URL by including additional query parameters. To start filtering add a `?` followed by the query `<query>=<value>`. If you want to chain several queries in the same call, use `&` followed by the query.

For example, If you want to check how many alive Ricks exist, just add `?name=rick&status=alive` to the URL.

Available parameters:
- `name`: filter by the given name.
- `status`: filter by the given status (`alive`, `dead` or `unknown`).
- `species`: filter by the given species.
- `type`: filter by the given type.
- `gender`: filter by the given gender (`female`, `male`, `genderless` or `unknown`).
